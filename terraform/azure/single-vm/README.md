# Deployment of a FortiGate-VM on Microsoft Azure using a FortiFlex license

## Introduction

A Terraform script to deploy a FortiGate-VM BYOL FortiFlex on Azure

## Requirements

* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) >= 0.12.0
* Terraform Provider AzureRM >= 2.38.0
* Terraform Provider FortiFlex >= 1.0.0

## Deployment overview

Terraform deploys the following components:

* Azure Virtual Network with 2 subnets
* One FortiGate-VM instances with 2 NICs
* Two firewall rules: one for external, one for internal.

## Deployment

To deploy the FortiGate-VM to Azure:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Customize variables in the `terraform.tfvars.example` and `variables.tf` file as needed.  And rename `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars`.
3. Initialize the providers and modules:

   ```sh
   terraform init
    ```

4. Submit the Terraform plan:

   ```sh
   terraform plan
   ```

5. Verify output.
6. Confirm and apply the plan:

   ```sh
   terraform apply
   ```

7. If output is satisfactory, type `yes`.

Output will include the information necessary to log in to the FortiGate-VM instances:

```sh

#
# FortiGate a standalone FortiGate VM
# Terraform deployment template for Microsoft Azure
#
# The FortiGate VMs are reachable via the public IP address of the load balancer.
#
# BEWARE: The state files contain sensitive data like passwords and others. After the demo clean up your
#         clouddrive directory.
#
# Deployment location: <FGT region>
# Username: <FGT username>
#
# Management FortiGate: https://<FGT Public IP>/
#

fgt_ipaddress = <FGT Public IP>
fgt_private_ip_address_ext = <FGT Private IP port 1>
fgt_private_ip_address_int = <FGT Private IP port 2>

```

```sh
